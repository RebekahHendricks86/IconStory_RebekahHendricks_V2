			<p> United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s skepticism around vaccines highlights a trend of vaccine hesitancy in Americans. Diseases that have been curbed by vaccine programs, such as measles, have been on the rise as vaccine skepticism becomes more common. </p>

				<p> There have been 42 outbreaks of measles in 2025. In 2024, there were only 16 reported outbreaks<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target= "_blank">(CDC)</a>.</p>

				<p> 63% of adults say that they have heard the myth that Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccines cause autism<a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-the-publics-views-on-measles-outbreaks-and-misinformation/">(KFF)</a>.</p>

			<p> The concern surrounding the current rates of measles in the US has a significant partisan divide. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, people within RFK Jr.’s party, Republicans, are less likely to be concerned about measles outbreaks. Democrats are more likely to be fearful of the disease. This is likely due to their outlook on the vaccine. Republicans are more likely than Democrats to think it is “probably true" that receiving an MMR vaccine is more dangerous than contracting the illnesses it prevents.</p>

				<p>The concern for vaccines is not isolated to the MMR vaccine. RFK Jr. has enacted guidelines that make the Covid-19 vaccine available to a limited group of Americans. Instead of recommending the booster vaccine to all adults, his new guidelines require the recipient to have an underlying condition that makes them susceptible to severe Covid-19 infections or live an inactive lifestyle. According to <a href="hhttps://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/03/20/more-americans-report-getting-a-flu-shot-than-the-updated-covid-19-vaccine-since-august/" target="_blank"> Pew Research</a>, as cold and flu season creeps up, Americans are less likely to get vaccinated against Covid-19 than the flu shot. </p>
